#+TITLE: The plu-311 "peak-of-apocalypse" 2020W1 term reading group

We meet on Mondays at 11AM Vancouver time (online via Zoom).  We
communicate via the ~plu-311~ departmental mailing list @ UBC.

* Reading group theme for this term
  We intend to discuss "PL papers old and new": We combine an old
  paper with a relatively recent paper whose ideas are deeply
  connected.
